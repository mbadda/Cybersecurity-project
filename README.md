# Cybersecurity-project
My Final Capstone Project

In this project, I simulated the job and tasks carried out by the main roles and positions that are available in multiple information security areas and fields.
The project was separated into 3 parts:

-Part [1] System Design, Architecture, & Administration

    •	Set up the environment securely and design the architecture for it, then set up two servers, install the operating systems, install different applications, and run them on the server. 
    
-Part [2] Offensive Cybersecurity 

    •	Initiate a red team engagement aiming to find the vulnerabilities in the system and exploit them to gain access.
    
-Part [3] Defensive Cybersecurity

    •	Detect the traces of the attack, then apply the right fixes and needed controls to fix the vulnerabilities and protect the system.
